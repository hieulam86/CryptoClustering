# CryptoClustering

1. clustering_analysis_original.ipynb
    Data loading and exploration.
    Data preprocessing, standardization, and encoding.
    K-Means clustering using the original data.
    Visual analysis of clusters.

2. clustering_analysis_pca.ipynb
    Data loading and PCA transformation.
    K-Means clustering using PCA-transformed data.
    Visual analysis of clusters.

## Results and Visualizations
  Elbow curves and cluster visualizations are available in the Jupyter Notebooks for both original and PCA-transformed data.

## Conclusion
  Analyze the impact of using fewer features through visual comparisons.
  Make observations on cluster separation, data compression, outliers, and computational efficiency.
